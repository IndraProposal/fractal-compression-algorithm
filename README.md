This repository contains an algorithm that leverages fractal geometry for efficient data compression. It can be applied to image and video compression, data storage, and network communication.

# Fractal Compression Algorithm

## Description

The Fractal Compression Algorithm (FCA) is a method that uses the self-similar properties of fractals to compress data. By identifying repeating patterns within the data and representing them as mathematical transformations, the FCA can achieve high compression ratios.

## Applications

The FCA can be used for various applications, including:

* Image and video compression: Reducing the file size of images and videos without significant loss of quality.
* Data storage: Compressing large datasets to save disk space.
* Network communication: Transmitting compressed data over a network to reduce bandwidth usage.

## Usage

To use the FCA, you first need to import the `fractal_compression` module. You can then compress and decompress data using the following functions:

* `compress(data)`: Compresses the input data and returns the compressed representation.
* `decompress(compressed_data)`: Decompresses the compressed data and returns the original data.

## Example

The following code compresses and decompresses an image:

```python
import fractal_compression

image_data = open("image.png", "rb").read()
compressed_data = fractal_compression.compress(image_data)
decompressed_data = fractal_compression.decompress(compressed_data)

# Save the decompressed data as an image
with open("decompressed_image.png", "wb") as file:
    file.write(decompressed_data)
```

## Documentation

Below is a basic example of the `fractal_compression.py` file. This code is a high-level representation and may require further development and refinement to be fully functional for specific applications.

```python
# fractal_compression.py

import numpy as np

def compress(data):
    """
    Compresses the input data using fractal geometry.

    :param data: The data to be compressed.
    :return: The compressed representation of the data.
    """
    # TODO: Implement the fractal compression algorithm
    compressed_data = None
    return compressed_data

def decompress(compressed_data):
    """
    Decompresses the compressed data using fractal geometry.

    :param compressed_data: The compressed representation of the data.
    :return: The original data.
    """
    # TODO: Implement the fractal decompression algorithm
    original_data = None
    return original_data

def _find_patterns(data):
    """
    Identifies repeating patterns within the data.

    :param data: The data to analyze.
    :return: A list of patterns and their transformations.
    """
    # TODO: Implement pattern finding logic
    patterns = None
    return patterns

def _apply_transformations(patterns):
    """
    Applies mathematical transformations to represent the patterns.

    :param patterns: The patterns to transform.
    :return: The transformed representation of the patterns.
    """
    # TODO: Implement transformation logic
    transformed_patterns = None
    return transformed_patterns

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = np.random.rand(100, 100)  # Example data
    compressed_data = compress(data)
    decompressed_data = decompress(compressed_data)
```

This code provides a skeleton for the Fractal Compression Algorithm, including functions for compression and decompression, as well as placeholders for pattern finding and transformation logic. The actual implementation of the fractal compression algorithm would require a deep understanding of fractal geometry and the specific requirements of the application.
